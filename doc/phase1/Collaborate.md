# Competencies and Constraints

Our team has a decent set of skills and experiences in application development. Most of us are competent in using latest frameworks and tools, and have worked in web development projects in the past using technologies such NodeJS, React, Express, and Mongo, amongst many others.

So far, we have not faced any particular constraints in terms of technical knowledge or scheduling conflicts, and we believe that the combined skills set of our team is fairly balanced.

  __Location__: On campus  
  __Attendees__: Everyone  
  __Agenda__: Finalize the set of use cases we want to support, and document them for future reference.

Our experience meeting so far has been very good. We plan to continue meeting in-person and on a weekly basis. Moreover, as we move forward into the later stages of our project, we may decide to meet more frequenly, if needed.

[](However, depending on our choice of database, there might be minor learning curve for some of our memebers.)


# Process

## Development Lifecylce
We have incorporated Kanban as our software development process and have chosen [Waffle](https://waffle.io) as our task management tool. Waffle integrates with GitHub Issues and organizes them as entries on a Kanban board. We will be ordering these entries based on their priorties, and will assign a _size_ (i.e. estimated number of hours) to each entry in order to quanity effort, and thereby, plan resource allocations.

We have created two smaller groups within our team, one of which will be focusing on the front-end of the application, while the other will be focusing on the back-end. Upon finishing with a particular task, members within each group will choose any outstanding items from the Kanban board and start working on them. According to our current estimation, we expect more effort to be required in implementing the back-end infrastructure than the front-end, and therefore, we have dedicated more members for building the former.


## Task Assignment Strategy

Tasks will be defined as granuarly as possible. However, what is considered to be "granular", will depend on the nature of the job. For instance, we might be articulating the implementation of a relatively complex API as a set of sub-tasks, while the more straight-forward ones might be listed as individual entries.

Individuals within each group will be assigned to tasks based on their preference, expertise, and their contributions to the team thus far. A task will be regarded as completed only when it has been tested and verified as per our guidlines defined in [Test.md](Test.md).

## Source Control Workflow
Each of our front and back-end teams will be working on their individual forks for day-to-day development work. Moreover, depending on the magnitude of parallel development, teams may choose to create new branches within each fork for working on separate features.

Code will only be merged into the [`master`](https://github.com/csc302-2017-spring/proj-TopOfTheHeap) branch of our master repo once it has been tested and verified by the respective dev team.

## Communication
So far all of our communication has taken place through Facebook group chat. Given that our members are easily accessible on Facebook, we plan to use it as our primary mode of communication in the development phase as well.

## Progress Metrics
The horizontal position of each task on the Kanban board will be used for evaluating progress. As with standard Kanban procedures, tasks will start on the left and shift through to the right in the following order, as they are worked upon and are eventually completed: *Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> Done*.

In addition, we will be using burndown charts and weekly throughput graphs for evaluating collective progress and efficiency, respectively.

## Shared Documents

All shared documents will be hosted on Google docs and linked below for easy access.
