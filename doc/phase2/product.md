    Short report (4-8 minâ€™ read)
    What did you actually build during this phase? 

    How is this different from what you originally proposed? Why?

    High-level design of your software.
    Technical highlights: interesting bugs, challenges, lessons learned, observations, etc.
    Reflect on your teamwork and process. What worked well, what  needs improvement.

    Ideally you will have specific artifacts from your development process to show (for instance, a burndown chart)

    Triage: What will you build for phase 3, the final demo?
